## iCheck-font
Adds font functionality to iCheck.js
Currently this is written in SASS but will port to SCSS, (Stylus?) and Less in the future.

### how to use

* clone repo
* customize & compile sass (don't need to, can use the css from dist too.)

I have included a demo, please take a look at that too.

### currently in development

Tested in following browsers, both mobile and desktop on windows 10/Android

I don't have access to other OS's / browsers. Will test later.

### to-do
